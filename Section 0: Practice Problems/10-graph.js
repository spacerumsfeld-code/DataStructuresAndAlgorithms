//1. Using the above building block, build a graph data structure with an "addVertex" method to add nodes to the graph.

class Graph {
  constructor () {
    this.list = {};
  }
};

//2. Build an "addEdge" method that connects two nodes together appropriately.

//3. Build a "removeVertex" method that removes a vertex and also any edges other nodes may have with that vertex.

//4. Build a "removeEdge" method that removes an edge between two nodes in the graph.

//5. Build a "dfs" method that performs a depth-first traversal of the graph that returns an array of all node values.

//6. Build a "bfs" method that performs a breadth-first traversal of the graph and returns an array of all node values.
