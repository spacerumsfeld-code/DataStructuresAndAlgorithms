Tree Traversal
//The next 4 sections will detail some of the more common methods of traversing or navigating around a tree structure. As with everything else when it comes to data structures and algorithms, there is not one "correct" answer as to which is best; they all have their own use cases where they excel (hence why we bother to learn them).

//Here are the approaches we will consider:
//Breadth-first search: work across the tree at each "level", or set of sibling nodes.
//Depth-first search: work down one side of the tree to the lowest level and navigate from there
  //DFS in-order
  //DFS pre-order
  //DFS post-order

//Note: these types of traversal pertain to all trees, not just binary search trees. We will implement BFS on both a BST and a basic starter tree!
