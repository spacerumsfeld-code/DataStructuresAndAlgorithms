The Priority Queue
//The priority queue is possibly the most common use of the binary heap data structure! In a priority queue, items are inserted in order of priority and not just value. When an item of a higher priority is inserted into the heap, it is moved to the front of the line. We can consider a priority queue exactly equivalent to a stand binary heap, except that ordering is undertaken by priority rating and not just value.
