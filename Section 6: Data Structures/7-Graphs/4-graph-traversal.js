Graph Traversal
//The next two sections will implement the joys of recursive traversal over graphs! We will look at a breadth-first approach and then a depth-first approach.

//The act of traversing is a graph is really what brings about their full use as a data structure; there isn't much point in building a graph of data if you cannot traverse it. Any and all real-life use cases of graphs entail traversing them in a variety of ways. With this motivation in hand, let's cover depth-first recursive graph traversal! Yay.
