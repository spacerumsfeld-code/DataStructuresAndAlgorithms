Data structures
//Data structures are simply collections of values, the relationships among them, and the various operations that can be performed on them. This section will focus on the non-default data structures, IE, not objects or arrays.

//In JS, we use class-based syntax to define and build data structures. This guide will be using the ES6 method of class creation/instantiation.

//Each data structure has its own advantages for different circumstances; there is no one "best" data structure! For example, for mapping or directional data, graphs reign supreme. Meanwhile, if you need an array that has constant time insertion and removal at the beginning of the data structure, a linked list is your go-to.

//Why should we care? As you spend more time as a software engineer, your chances go up of eventually needing to use one of these data structures. Oh, and interviews brah.

//Items to be covered:
//Singly-linked Lists
//Doubly-linked lists
//Stacks
//Queues
//Trees
//Binary Trees
//Binary Heaps
//Hash Tables
//Graphs
