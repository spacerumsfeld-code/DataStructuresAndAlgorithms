Divide-and-Conquer Pattern
//  this section will give brief details of the d&d pattern. The reason it will be brief is that we will encounter plenty of d&d whne we come to sorting algorithms. At the very least, though, we will get a general idea of the thought process behind the pattern as mental prep for the sorting algorithms to come.

//  At its core, the d&d pattern hinges on dividing data into subsets and running operations on just those subsets. This allows for logarithmic time complexity, or decreasing time complexity as n increases, which is ideal!

//  The prototypical example of the d&d pattern is the binary search! But we will come to that shortly.
