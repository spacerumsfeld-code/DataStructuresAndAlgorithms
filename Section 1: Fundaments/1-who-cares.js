//  Big-O: Who cares?

//  Big-O notation provides an easy way to assess the efficiency of code against other code; while there are many, many ways to solve a given problem, some are more efficient than others. Big-O notation gives us a tool to assess these differences

//  Understanding time and space complexity leads to better code, to say nothing of the advantages of performing better during interviews. Especially at big companies who may be handling absolutely huge amounts of data, time and space complexity matter!
